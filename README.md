This is an issues-only repo for Terminal Click (TC), a native desktop terminal that recognizes user intent and supports it with rich graphics. Zero AI is involved.

TC is:
- Designed by a full-time [indie dev](https://abner.page/about)
- 100% offline binary: it's yours to own forever
- Determined to [kill](https://terminal.click/posts/2025/04/the-wizard-and-his-shell/) traditional shells

TC is Handmade software. Watch the 2025 [demo](https://terminal.click/suckless) comparing the Handmade and suckless terminals.

## FAQ

1. **Is Terminal Click open-source?** *No. Much like [Warp](https://github.com/warpdotdev), our repo is for users to report issues. Unlike Warp, however, we're not a VC-backed startup needing to make back millions of dollars; I just want to pay my rent!*

2. **How do I purchase the binary?** *A: We're in so-called open beta. For five bucks a month you get new versions of TC to your Inbox. Sign up over at https://terminal.click/beta (cancel anytime!)*

3. **Are you open to open-source?** *A: Once we reach a 1.0 stable release, we will switch from monthly subscription to a one-off payment system. At that time, if adoption takes off, I'm quite willing to flirt with a Business Source License.*
